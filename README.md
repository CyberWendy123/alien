(!) This program does require pygame to be installed.

This has been rather interesting to follow along. 
Understandably while it does hand hold me through out the entire process, it has been my own hands typing the code, my brain learning what is infront of me, and my own ability to debug my mistakes. A lot of it does involve understanding how the pygame library works and that will be critical for any future games I may want to create. 

Obstacles I had to Face 
Pygame does not work for the homebrew version of Python3; must download from the original python site. 
Little bugs due to spelling situations (easy fix) 
Currently: 
self.font = pygame.font.SysFont(None, 15) - crashes the game
