based on p 249 in the book:
try these two exercises

12-1  Blue Sky:
Make a pygame window with a blue background

12-2  Game Character:
Find a bitmap (or as of 2019, .png works just as well) image of a game character you like or covert an image to a bitmap. Make a class that draws the character at the center of the screen and match the background color of the image to the background color of the screen, or vice versa.
